# Convenience-Store
Program emulates buying items at a convenience store.

Using functions, pointers, and file systems, I created a program that emulates the user buying items at a convenience store.
The user is shown a welcome message and a menu of items and their prices, the user enters what they would like to purchase.
The user is then prompted to enter the quantity they wish to purchase of this particular item.
The user may add to the order if needed.
Otherwise, the bill is calculated (with HST) and displayed to the user.
The user must enter the amount they wish to pay.
If the amount entered is less than the total amount owed, then the program will keep prompting more payments until the entire bill has been paid.
If the amount entered is greater than the total amount owed, then the user will recieve change.
After the bill has been paid, the user is given the reciept.
The user must then complete a customer survey, rating the customer service out of 5.
The program reads the survey result back to the user and the program terminates.
